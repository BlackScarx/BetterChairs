# BetterChairs
This is the official Repository for BetterChairs provided on SpigotMC (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/better-chairs.18705/).

## You came here to download the latest version?
Good first step! But there is no *real* official download here.
The one writing this is @Sprax2013 and I have gained access to the project by the original Author @BlackScarx.

BlackScarx has been inactive for quite a while and I try to take over this project officially.

**A newer version supporting 1.15.2 and other versions can be found at https://github.com/Sprax2013/BetterChairs/releases.**

**BUT PLEASE keep an eye on the SpigotMC-Page** - I'm still trying to contact the original author.


## Status of this repository?
Hard to say, as the original author is sadly inactive...

**I wrote the currenty status down at [BlackScarx/BetterChairs#15](https://github.com/BlackScarx/BetterChairs/issues/15).**
